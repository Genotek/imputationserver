# Imputationserver

Michigan Imputation Server provides a free genotype imputation service using [Minimac3](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac3). You can upload phased or unphased GWAS genotypes and receive phased and imputed genomes in return. Our server offers imputation from HapMap, 1000 Genomes (Phase 1 and 3), CAAPA and the new [HRC](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) reference panel. For all uploaded data sets an extensive QC is performed.
