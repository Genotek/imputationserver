# Michigan Imputation Server

Michigan Imputation Server provides a free genotype imputation service using [Minimac4](http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Minimac4). You can upload phased or unphased GWAS genotypes and receive phased and imputed genomes in return. Our server offers imputation from HapMap, 1000 Genomes (Phase 1 and 3), CAAPA, [HRC](http://www.haplotype-reference-consortium.org/) and the [TOPMed](http://nhlbiwgs.org/) reference panel. For all uploaded data sets an extensive QC is performed.

The complete source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/genepi/imputationserver/tree/qc-refactoring) using Travis CI for continuous integration.
