# Data sensitivity

Since data is transfered to our server located in Michigan, a wide array of security measures are in force:

*   The complete interaction with the server is secured with HTTPS.
*   Input data is deleted from our servers as soon it is not needed anymore.
*   We only store the number of samples and markers analyzed, we don't ever "look" at your data in anyway.
*   All results are encrypted with a strong one-time password - thus, only you can read them.
*   After imputation is finished, the data uploader has 7 days to use an encrypted connection to get results back.
*   The complete source code will be available on a public repository.
